# Shopping-Cart

## Description
A project made by MITXPro, to demonstrate placing items in a shopping cart.
Built using Strapi, with Postman as a tester.
This allows users to add and remove items from their cart, while also updating the stock and cart price.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download all files to your machine.
2. Navigate to the root folder within the terminal
3. Run npm Install, followed by npx http-server -c1 in order to create the server. From there, the application should open in your browser!

## Future Improvements
I would like to possibly add more items, as well as update the styling.
